            I have over 2 years of experience as a full stack web developer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in front-end
        </p>

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to building nice layouts that would attract more people with satisfaction
           I'm looking for a contributor role where I can gain more experience.
